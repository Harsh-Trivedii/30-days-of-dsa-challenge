Problem: Maximum sum of hour glass

Question: Given two integers N, M and a 2D matrix Mat of dimensions NxM, the task is to find the maximum sum of
an hourglass.
An hourglass is made of 7 cells in the following form.
    A B C
      D
    E F G
    
    Example 1:

Input:
N=3,M=3
Mat=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output:
35
Explanation:
There is only one hour glass which is
1 2 3
   5
7 8 9 and its sum is 35.

Expected Time Complexity:O(N*M)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
